# 1. Previous work:
How to identify influential spreaders effectively and efficiently is a big challenge up to now. A large number of centrality
indices have been proposed to address this problem, such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness
centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
These centrality measures have already been extended to be widely applied in complex networks. Gao et al. proposed
a bio-inspired centrality measure model, which combines the Physarum centrality with the K-shell index obtained by
K-shell decomposition analysis, to identify influential nodes. Bonacich and Lloyd proposed an extension of the eigenvector
centrality measure to deal with the problem when the graphs are asymmetric, the eigenvectors of asymmetric matrices
are not orthogonal. Restrepo et al. presented a quantitative, objective characterization of the dynamical importance
of network nodes and links in terms of their effect on the largest eigenvalue. Gómez et al. extended the betweenness
centrality measure to take into account explicitly several dimensions. A new closeness centrality measure is defined to deal
not only with the maximum flow between every ordered pair of nodes, but also with the cost associated with communications.
There have been many researches to improve the centrality measures to identify influential nodes in complex
networks. However, all these researches focused on only one centrality measure and every centrality measure has its own
disadvantage and limitation.

# 2. Problem description:
TOPSIS is utilized to evaluate the importance of nodes and
identify influential nodes by regarding the centrality measures as the multi-attribute of complex network. To evaluate the
algorithmic performance, we use the Susceptible–Infected (SI) model to examine the spreading influence of the nodes
ranked by different centrality measures.
